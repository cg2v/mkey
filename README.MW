# MiniWorld README for mkey

Dependencies: gmake krb4 heimdal
Build:        gmake all install

This collection contains a server, client library, and command-line tool
for managing encryption keys; specifically the Kerberos database master
key(s).  The mkey server holds keys in mlock()'d memory, and performs
encryption operations as requested by the KDC and other tools.  In this
manner, the actual master key need never be stored on disk.

NB: This collection has a circular dependency on 'heimdal'.  In particular,
the mkey server and client need krb5 headers and libraries provided by the
heimdal collection; libhdb, which manages the Heimdal KDC database, depends
on libmkey.

To bootstrap, build and install libmkey.so and the headers first, then
go build heimdal, and finally come back and build the rest of mkey.
To acheive this, you will want to first manually compile the mkey_err
error tables, using the compile_et from krb4.  Then 'gmake libmkey.so.0',
and manually install the shared library and headers.  You can then build
and release heimdal, followed by the rest of mkey.
